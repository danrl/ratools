ratools
=======

This is ratools, a fast, dynamic, multi-threading framework for creating,
modifying and sending IPv6 Router Advertisements (RA).


Quick Introduction
------------------

See this 4 minute video to get a brief overview.

Architecture
------------

The basic idea is to have two programs. On the one hand a
powerful CLI, called ratools/ractl, for manipulating the
configuration. And on the other hand an efficient, non-bloated
stable daemon process, called ratools/rad. As depicted below,
both programs communicate with each other via an UNIX socket.


                              +------------------+
                              |                  +-- eth0
                              |  ratools/rad     +-- eth1
                              |                  +--  :
                              |           Daemon +-- ethN
                              +---+--------------+
    +------------------+          |
    |                  |          |
    |  ratools/ractl   |          |
    |                  +----------+ AF_UNIX
    |              CLI |
    +------------------+


The internal structure of ratools/rad looks like this:



       + KERNEL                        + INTERFACES
       |                               |
    +--+-------------+              +--+-------------+

       + CLI



Building
--------

Although ratools is complex from the inside, the code looks very POSIX-ish from
the outside. Thus, bulding is relatively easy. Clone the repository and type
`make`. It is as simple as that!

    $ git clone https://github.com/danrl/ratools.git
    Cloning into 'ratools'...
    [...]
    $ cd ratools/src/
    $ make
    [...]


Quick start
-----------

First start the daemon (ratools/rad)

    # rad --loglevel info
    ratools/rad v0.6.1 (March 2015)
    Written by Dan Luedtke <mail@danrl.de>
    Log: Level set to `info'.
    Info: Netlink: Thread started.
    Info: Listener: Thread started.

Now use the CLI (ratools/ractl) to create a new RA

    # ractl ra@dummy0 create

How about advertising the link MTU?

    # mtu@dummy0 create
    # mtu@dummy0 enable

It is also nice to let clients know the source link-layer address.

    # sll@dummy0 create
    # sll@dummy0 enable

Of course we like to advertise at least one prefix!

    # pi0@dummy0 create
    # pi0@dummy0 set prefix 2001:db8::/64
    # pi0@dummy0 enable

Nice routers come with recursive DNS server addresses as well:

    # rdnss0@dummy0 create
    # rdnss0@dummy0 add server 2001:db8::53
    # rdnss0@dummy0 enable

Let's enable our little fella:

    # ra@dummy0 enable

Have at look at your ICMPv6 masterpiece using the CLI

    # ractl show
    Router Advertisement `ra@dummy0':

        Server:               2001:db8::53


To save your work you can dump the configuration:

    # ractl dump
    ra@dummy0 create
    mtu@dummy0 create
    mtu@dummy0 enable
    sll@dummy0 create
    sll@dummy0 enable
    pi0@dummy0 create
    pi0@dummy0 set prefix 2001:db8::/64
    pi0@dummy0 enable
    rdnss0@dummy0 create
    rdnss0@dummy0 add server 2001:db8::53
    rdnss0@dummy0 enable
    ra@dummy0 enable

Best pratice is to save the configuration to a file:

    # ractl dump > example.conf

If you want to restore the configuration at a later time, just pipe it into
ratools/ractl:

    # ractl < example.conf

Please make sure to always use the latest version before reporting bugs. Thanks!

    # ractl version
